Implementation of a gradient descent algorithm to predict prices of second-hand smartphones, using the original price and the age of the device.

In the first part I will load the data and display it with a function called loadData.
In the second part, I will normalize the device prices using a function called normalizePrices.
In the third part I will implement the function predictValue - this function receives an example and a hypothesis, and returns the value predicted by the hypothesis for this example.
Next, I will implement the functions computeErrors , computeCost , computeGradient and updateHypothsis .
And finally I will implement the algorithm using the functions I implemented earlier.
